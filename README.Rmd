The `bfcr` package provides functions to perform nonparametric Bayesian inference for covariate-adjusted covariance operators with functional response data as described in "Bayesian functional covariance regression" by Shamshoian et al. (2021). This package contains a C++ implementation of the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo sampling algorithm in the Supporting Information document and several convenience functions for extracting posterior summaries. The online GitHub repository contains all code used in the analysis of the resting state EEG data from children with autism spectrum disorder as well as the sleep waveforms collected on patients' polysomnography from SHHS visit 1. However, both of these data sets are not publicly available so we illustrate our methods with a simulated example.

## Installation 

Simply install with GitHub by using the R package `devtools.`

```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("devtools")
  }
# devtools::install_github("jshamsho/bfcr")
```

## Example
### Simulated data set description
We will simulate a data set akin to one generated under case 1 conditions from the main manuscript. This data set will have ![formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?N&space;=&space;100) response curves with population mean and heteroscedasticity dependending on a single covariate ![formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x). Following notation from the manuscript, the data generating model for the ![formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i)th response curve at time ![formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?t) has functional mean ![formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mu(t,&space;x_{i})), random deviation ![formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?r_{i}(t,&space;x_{i})), and measurement source error ![formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\epsilon_{i}(t))).
