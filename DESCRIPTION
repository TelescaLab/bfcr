Description: Implements Bayesian covariance functional regression as described in the Manuscript "Bayesian covariance functional regression" by Shamshoian et al. (2021). The core of this package provides nonparametric inference of covariate-adjusted patterns of covariation with functional response data. This package contains efficient C++ functions for full posterior sampling and inferential summaries.
